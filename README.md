## ‚ú® Features

*   **Accurate OCR Processing:** Leverage state-of-the-art OCR technology to reliably extract text from diverse resume formats, including scanned documents and PDFs.
*   **Structured Data Extraction:** Automatically identify and extract key information such as names, contact details, work experience, education, and skills into a structured format.
*   **Efficient Document Handling:** Designed for batch processing, allowing you to quickly process multiple resumes and streamline your recruitment workflow.
*   **Modular Design:** Built with a modular architecture, making it easy to extend, customize, and integrate with existing HR systems or other data pipelines.
*   **Sample Dataset Included:** Comes with a pre-packaged `OCR Resumes Dataset` for easy testing, development, and demonstration purposes.


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the Resume-OCR-extraction project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   git

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rithaa24/Resume-OCR-extraction.git
cd Resume-OCR-extraction
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment.

**On Windows:**

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages. This project relies on the `doctr` library for OCR.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(Note: A `requirements.txt` file is assumed for standard Python projects. If not present, create one with `doctr` and other necessary libraries.)*

```
# Example requirements.txt content:
# doctr[torch]  # or doctr[tensorflow] depending on your backend preference
# Pillow
# opencv-python
# numpy
```


## üöÄ Usage Examples

Once installed, you can use the scripts to perform OCR and data extraction on your resumes.

### Basic OCR Extraction

To run the basic OCR process on a single resume:

```bash
python ocr.py --input_path "path/to/your/resume.pdf" --output_dir "output/"
```

### Doctr-based Information Extraction

To use the `doctr_extraction.py` script for more structured information extraction:

```bash
python doctr_extraction.py --input_path "path/to/your/resume.png" --output_format "json"
```

Replace `"path/to/your/resume.pdf"` or `"path/to/your/resume.png"` with the actual path to your resume file. The `--output_dir` specifies where to save the extracted data.

### Example Output (JSON format)

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "phone": "+1-123-456-7890",
  "experience": [
    {
      "title": "Software Engineer",
      "company": "Tech Solutions Inc.",
      "duration": "2020 - Present"
    }
  ],
  "education": [
    {
      "degree": "B.Sc. Computer Science",
      "university": "State University",
      "year": "2019"
    }
  ],
  "skills": ["Python", "Machine Learning", "OCR"]
}
```



## üõ£Ô∏è Project Roadmap

We have exciting plans for the future development of Resume-OCR-extraction:

*   **V1.1 - Enhanced Accuracy & Format Support:**
    *   Improve OCR accuracy for handwritten sections and complex resume layouts.
    *   Add support for additional input formats (e.g., DOCX).
*   **V1.2 - Advanced Entity Recognition:**
    *   Implement more sophisticated Named Entity Recognition (NER) for better extraction of less common fields.
    *   Integrate with external APIs for validation of extracted data (e.g., company names).
*   **V1.3 - Web Interface & API:**
    *   Develop a user-friendly web interface for easy resume upload and data visualization.
    *   Provide a RESTful API for seamless integration with other applications.
*   **Future - Cloud Integration & Scalability:**
    *   Explore cloud-native deployment options for highly scalable processing.
    *   Integrate with popular HR platforms for direct resume ingestion.
